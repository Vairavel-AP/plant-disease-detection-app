        "Preventive Measures": "1. Choose resistant crabapple cultivars.\n2. Plant cedar trees far from apple trees.\n3. Remove cedar galls in fall or winter.\n4. Apply fungicides preventively in spring, following label instructions.\n5. Ensure good air circulation around trees by proper pruning.",
        "Immediate Actions": "1. Remove and destroy infected leaves and fruit immediately.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves to prevent fungal overwintering.\n3. Apply a fungicide labeled for cedar apple rust, following instructions carefully.\n4. Prune out infected branches, especially on junipers (cedar hosts).\n5. Plant resistant apple and crabapple varieties in the future.",
        "Long-Term Solutions": "1. **Resistant tree varieties:** Plant crabapple and apple cultivars with known resistance to cedar-apple rust.\n2. **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected leaves and galls promptly, especially from both juniper and apple trees.\n3. **Proper spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between apple and juniper trees to reduce spore transmission.\n4. **Fungicide application:** Apply protective fungicides during periods of high infection risk (spring and fall), following label instructions carefully.\n5. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine multiple strategies above for a holistic approach, minimizing reliance on chemical controls."

    "Apple_Apple_scab": {
        "Preventive Measures": "Use scab-resistant apple varieties.  Practice good orchard sanitation, removing fallen leaves and fruit.  Apply copper-based fungicides or other approved treatments as needed, following label instructions.  Ensure proper air circulation within the tree canopy through pruning. Maintain tree vigor through appropriate fertilization and watering.",
        "Immediate Actions": "1. **Isolate affected plants:** Prevent spread to healthy trees.\n2. **Prune and remove infected leaves and branches:** Dispose of them properly, ideally burning or bagging for landfill.\n3. **Improve air circulation:** Thin out branches to reduce humidity.\n4. **Apply a fungicide:** Choose a product labeled for apple scab; follow instructions carefully.\n5. **Clean up fallen leaves:**  Remove all debris from around the base of the tree to reduce overwintering spores.",
        "Long-Term Solutions": "1.  **Resistant rootstocks:** Planting apple trees on scab-resistant rootstocks is crucial for long-term control.\n2.  **Sanitation:**  Remove and destroy fallen leaves and fruit to reduce overwintering inoculum.\n3.  **Cultural practices:** Improve air circulation through proper tree spacing and pruning to reduce humidity.\n4.  **Integrated pest management (IPM):**  Combine biological controls (e.g., beneficial microorganisms) with targeted fungicide applications only when necessary.\n5.  **Careful fungicide selection:** Use fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development, rotating products as needed."

        "Preventive Measures": "1. Use virus-resistant tomato varieties.\n2. Employ strict sanitation practices, removing infected plants promptly.\n3. Control whitefly vectors with insecticides or biological control methods.\n4. Practice crop rotation to disrupt the virus's life cycle.\n5. Use certified, virus-free planting materials.",
        "Immediate Actions": "1. **Remove and destroy infected plants immediately:**  Bag them to prevent spread.\n2. **Control insect vectors:** Use appropriate insecticides to target whiteflies, the primary spreaders.\n3. **Improve plant hygiene:** Remove weeds and maintain good air circulation to reduce humidity.\n4. **Monitor closely:** Regularly inspect plants for new infections.\n5. **Consider resistant varieties:** Plant TYLCV-resistant tomato cultivars in the future.",
        "Long-Term Solutions": "1. **Resistant cultivars:**  Plant tomato varieties bred for resistance to TYLCV.\n2. **Vector control:**  Manage whitefly populations through biological control (e.g., beneficial insects) and/or chemical insecticides.\n3. **Sanitation:**  Remove and destroy infected plants promptly; practice good hygiene in the greenhouse.\n4. **Crop rotation:** Avoid planting tomatoes in the same location for consecutive seasons.\n5. **Seed health:** Use certified virus-free seeds or seedlings."
